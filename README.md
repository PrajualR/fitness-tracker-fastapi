##  Features

- This project builds a machine learning-based system to classify strength training sets based on sensor data. It includes:

- Data preprocessing (filtering, PCA, feature engineering)
- Outlier detection and removal
- Model training using XGBoost
- A RESTful API served via FastAPI for predictions
